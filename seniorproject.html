				<h1 style=" color: #00154F; font-size: 110%; font-family: Rockwell; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.6em;">Project Overview:</h1>
				
				This senior project was based upon an online computer store.  Throughout the semester, my team and I created and developed a multi-page website that offered many different products and services.  During this project, most of the time I was considered a Developer.  I was held responsible for 3 web pages throughout the semester that were assigned to me in the beginning. Another major responsibility was the incorporation of geolocation.  This requirement was fulfilled by creating a shipping calculator that pulled the users country, using a Google API.  Once the country was found, if the user was located within the United States, free shipping was assigned.  On the other hand, if the user was in a country outside of the U.S., there was an assigned $19.99 shipping cost.  The other two web pages I did were the Laptops page and the Desktops page.  I also had a section about myself in the About Us page. Also, I worked on part of the CSS stylesheet. As for the managerial side, I was tasked with completing parts of both the Web Design Brief and the SDP.  I also helped assign individual tasks throughout the length of the project.

				<h2 style=" color: #00154F; font-size: 110%; font-family: Rockwell; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.6em;">Tools Utilizied:</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Gantt Chart</strong></li>
						<p class="p3">
						-The Gantt Chart is used as a schedule for the project. It shows the amount of work done in certain periods of time in relation to the amount planned for those periods. So for a software project, you can use it to keep you on track of deadlines.  It is a nice way to see what is ahead, and not fall behind with current tasks.  This tool really helped our group remain within a timeline, stay organized and communicate current and future tasks.
						<br>
						-For a manager, this gives you a look at the current state of the project and if you are on track to meet deadlines. It also assists with organizing and planning and shows what you need to prioritize your time to and who is in control of what task. 
						</p>
					<li><strong>GitHub</strong></li>
						<p class="p4">
						-GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows teams to work together on projects from anywhere. For a software project, it can be used for teams working on coding some form of software. All code is saved in a repository and anyone within the team can update the code, just by saving, pulling, then pushing it.
						<br>
						-From a managerial perspective, GitHub provides an easy way for development teams to store/update code whenever they want. This helps to create organization and efficiency.
						<br> 
						-Our group benefited from GitHub through organization during this project by being able to store our code in a repository, then change/update the code anytime we wanted to, updating for all of us.  We could also see what changes were made and the history of changes.
						</p>
					<li><strong>Trello</strong></li>
						<p class="p5">
						-Trello was used as a backlog for the project. It assigns all tasks into three different categories: finished tasks, current tasks, and future tasks. This could be used for any project as a backlog for what you have done, what youâ€™re currently working on, and future work and is very easy to use and update.
						<br>
						-For a manager, this also gives you an idea of how the project is going and you can see exactly which tasks are completed, which are being worked on, and what needs to be done in the future.  You can also assign tasks to different people within the board.
						<br> 
						-I believe Trello is a nice way to step back from a task and ensure a group is working on time and with the right tasks.  It also allows group members to narrow in on what tasks need to be completed, while enhancing communication.
						</p>
					<li><strong>Slack</strong></li>
						<p class="p6">
						-Slack was used for notes concerning what is being done, what will be done, and challenges occurred.  Slack could be used in teams to communicate with each other and post some notes or ideas concerning different aspects of the project.
						<br>
						-From a managerial perspective, this provides a way of communication in a group. Slack is beneficial if you have a group that has to work together remotely and provide notes regarding timelines, priorities, organization, shared tasks and more. 
						</p>
					<li><strong>Sublime Text Editor</strong></li>
						<p class="p7">
						-Sublime is the text editor for code, markup and prose that we chose to deploy. For a software project, this could be used for coding. This text editor allowed us to make changes/updates to our code. 
						<br>
						-From a managerial perspective, this provides coders with a tool to write and edit their code. This makes coding more efficient for the coders which can assist with timelines, organization, and tasks.
						<br>
						-While this tool did not provide much assistance to communication, it did help with organization when it comes to all the code itself. It was easy to use and provided some beneficial features such as color and recommendations.
						</p>
