                Below are several projects I have completed concerning the construction and design of Database Management Systems.  The DMS software that was used to complete these projects was MySQL and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

                <h1 style=" color: #00154F; font-size: 110%; font-family: Rockwell; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.6em;">Ch. 3 Project</h1>
                This project consists of developing a database and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a classic car museum database system.  Data was stored in the database for cars, car owners, and the museum.  The project consists of the database design including tables, fields, and relationships.  All the entity types that can fully describe this database system and its environment are specified, as well as the relation types among them.

                This project deals with the creation of a movie theater database using SSMS.  Through the Table Designer, tables and keys were created.  Also, using the editor, test data was added to the tables.  An ER diagram was created with the addition of relationships.  Potential uses, actors, and users were all defined in this project with additional table designs.

                In this project, a hotel business database was created consisting of four main tables.  This database was created based upon several predetermined requirements including primary and foreign keys.  SQL INSERT statements were also utilized to insert rows into the tables.  An INSERT trigger was deployed as well to perform calculations.

                In this project, a company database was created using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  Once the database was created, several SQL queries were deployed in order to accomplish the results of relational algebra queries.

                This project was focused on applying the process of normalization to volunteer project data.  After the process of normalization was completed, the volunteer project database was created in SSMS.
